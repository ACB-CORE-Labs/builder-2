## Runtime Policy & Architectural Invariants

- no shell execution is enabled
- no model execution is enabled
- no patch application is enabled
- no autonomous writes are enabled
- no Goose runtime activation is enabled
- no deepagents runtime is enabled
- builder-II is not CORE Workbench/UI
- CORE is only a target profile


## Reconciliation additions

These command surfaces are registered in `pyproject.toml` and remain governed by builder-II's default no-autonomous-execution boundary unless their specific documentation states a narrower read-only or artifact-only behavior.

- `builder-orchestration`
